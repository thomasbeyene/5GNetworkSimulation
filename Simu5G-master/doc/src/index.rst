Simu5G: Simulator for 5G New Radio Networks
===========================================

Simu5G is the evolution of the popular `SimuLTE 4G network simulator <https://simulte.omnetpp.org>`__
that incorporates 5G New Radio access.
Based on the OMNeT++ framework, it is written in C++ and is
fully customizable with a simple pluggable interface. One can
also develop new modules implementing new algorithms and
protocols.

Using Simu5G
------------

The idea behind Simu5G is to let researchers simulate and
benchmark their solutions on an easy-to-use framework. It
borrows the concept of modularity from OMNeT++ thus it is
easy to extend. Moreover it can be integrated with other
modules from the INET Framework. It offers support to
optimization tools (e.g. optimization solvers such as CPLEX).
Simu5G is compatible with
`SimuLTE <https://simulte.omnetpp.org/>`__, and allows one to
simulate network scenarios where 4G and 5G coexist, in both
StandAlone (SA) and E-UTRA/NR Dual Connectivity (ENDC)
deployments. Furthermore, it inherits SimuLTE's compatiblity
with other OMNeT++-based libraries, for instance Veins for
vehicular mobility.

System Requirements
-------------------

Simu5G can be used on any system compatible with OMNeT++
(Windows, Linux or macOS). See
`OMNeT++ <https://omnetpp.org/>`__ page for more info.
Simu5G requires:

-  OMNeT++ v6.0.x
-  INET-Framework v4.5.x

For more information and installation instructions, see the
:doc:`install`.
