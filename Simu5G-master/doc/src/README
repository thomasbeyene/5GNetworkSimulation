Simu5G Framework Documentation
==============================

Building the documentation website
----------------------------------

The Simu5G documentation is built with the Sphinx tool (sphinx-doc.org).
A pipenv environment is set up automatically containing all the necessary python packages.

To build the documentation, you have to install `pipenv` first:
$ sudo apt install pipenv

After that, you can use the following targets (dependencies will be installed
automatically on the first use)

- Use 'make server' to run a local web server to preview the documentation at
  http://localhost:8000/
- Use 'make html' or 'make pdf' to build the documentation.
- Use 'make clean all' to build both the html and pdf version from scratch.
